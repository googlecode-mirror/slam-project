Installing SLAM
===============

Please note: if you are upgrading SLAM from a previous version, please read the "UPGRADING.txt" file instead of this one.

1. Assuming you haven't downloaded the latest version of SLAM, please obtain it from steelsnowflake.com/SLAM

2. Untar or unzip the distribution, e.g.: "tar -xzvf SLAM_x.x.x.tgz" in your webserver's document root.

3. Ensure that all the scripts and directories have the appropriate owner permissions (they must be readable/writable by the webserver user)

4. Open slam/install/index.php in your web browser to setup and configure this SLAM installation. For detailed step-by-step instructions, please read the installation instructions available at steelsnowflake.com/SLAM

5. The web-based install and configuration, will create two files in the SLAM directory: "configuration.ini" and "preferences.ini" These files may be edited by hand if you wish to change any advanced options.

6. SLAM is now installed, and it may be accessed by opening the SLAM directory in your web browser.

7. You may wish to deny web access to the ./lib and ./mod directories. The provided .htaccess files will accomplish this for Apache, but should be configured for other webservers.

8. Lastly, the "install" directory may now be removed, if desired.
