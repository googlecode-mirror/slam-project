SLAM (SQL-based Laboratory Asset Management) is a web-based tool to help research groups organize and maintain important information on their research samples.

It was designed from the ground-up to be intuitive to use and easy to modify in order to suit each lab’s unique needs. Many existing solutions are often too complex and cumbersome to use, while providing unnecessary complicating features.

SLAM is designed expressly to address these problems while transparently using the industry-standard MySQL database system. SLAM’s innovative approach is to utilize the database not only for storage of data, but for the structure. This ensures that your data will always be easily retrievable, even by third-party utilities.

SLAM is licensed under the GPL and free for anyone to download and modify. For more information, please visit [steelsnowflake.com/SLAM](http://steelsnowflake.com/SLAM/)
